# Xpense

Xpense is intended to be an app to help keep track of your expenses and budget. It is currently a work in progress. The Android app is available for download on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xpense.android)

This app integrates with Firebase service. To build the app, you need to link it to a Firebase project. You can create your own project on Firebase, and download the config file (google-services.json) to the `app` module root folder.

## Wishlist:
- equivalent iOS app
- equivalent Huawei app
- equivalent flutter app (exported to Android and iOS)
