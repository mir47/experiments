# Xpense

Xpense is intended to be an app to help keep track of your expenses and budget. It is currently a work in progress, and is available for download on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xpense.android). Future apps are planned for iOS, Huawei, and Flutter.

To build the app:
- Add `MAPS_API_KEY` to `local.properties`. See example in `local.properties.example`.
- This app integrates with Firebase services and needs to be linked to a Firebase project. You can create your own project on Firebase, and download the config file (google-services.json) to the `app` module root folder.
