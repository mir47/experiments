## Privacy Policy

This is an Android app developed by Miroslav Minev. I take privacy very seriously and I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

This app is used to track and manage budget. The SMS feature is used to recognize transaction messages and provide a convenient way to auto create transaction items in the app.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data input is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
